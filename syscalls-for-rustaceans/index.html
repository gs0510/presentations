        <aside class="notes">
          Before I begin talking about syscalls, I want to talk about what even is a systems programming language?
          It's a term you hear a lot when talking about Rust! How Rust is a new systems programming language? But what
          makes a programming language suitable for systems programming?

          What makes C, C++, Rust good candidates for systems programming and Python, Perl not so good candidates?
          I want us to take a tour through history, and talk about the evolution of systems programming languages!

          I will focus on these themes:
          1. What does it mean to be a systems programming language?
          2. What makes Rust a good candidate for systems programming language?
          3. Learn about system calls, and getting started with writing your first
          systems program in Rust!

          In Systems Programming Languages (Bergeron1 et al. 1972), the authors say: "A system is an integrated set of
          subprograms exceeding some threshold of size or complexity."

          Typical examples are systems for multiprogramming, translating, simulating, managing information, and time
          sharing.

          The paper then goes on to define what a "systems program" looks like!
          The system program is likely to be used to support other software and applications programs, but may also be a
          complete applications package itself.
          for example, most application programs read from and write to files on disk. The operating system, written in
          a systems programming language like C provides this functionality. It makes sure programs have the permissions
          to access the files, handles multiple programs accessing the same file, loads blocks of files into memory and
          so on.

          It is likely to be continuously evolving in the number and types of
          features it supports.
          This definition is fairly agreeable‚Äîcomputer systems are large-scale, long-used, and time-varying. However,
          while this definition is largely descriptive, a key idea in the paper is prescriptive: advocating for the
          separation of low-level languages from systems languages (at the time, contrasting assembly with FORTRAN).

          What is systems programming? You may visualize a computer as some sort of beast that obeys all commands. It
          has been said that computers are basically people made out of metal or, conversely, people are computers made
          out of flesh and blood. However, once we get close to computers, we see that they are basically machines that
          follow very specific and primitive instructions. In the early days of computers, people communicated with them
          by on and off switches denoting primitive instructions. Soon people wanted to give more complex instructions.
          For example, they wanted to be able to say X = 30 * Y; given that Y = 10, what is X? Present day computers
          cannot understand such language without the aid of systems programs. Systems programs (e.g. compilers,
          loaders, macro processors, operating systems) were developed to make computers better adapted to the needs of
          their users. Further, people wanted more assistance in the mechanics of preparing their programs.

          In the 70s and 80s, it seems like most researchers saw systems programming usually as a contrast to assembly
          programming. There simply were no other good tools to build systems

          ‚ÄúScripting: Higher Level Programming for the 21st Century‚Äù (Ousterhout 1998)
          Scripting languages are designed for different tasks than system programming languages, and this leads to
          fundamental differences in the languages. System programming languages were designed for building data
          structures and algorithms from scratch, starting from the most primitive computer elements such as words of
          memory. In contrast, scripting languages are designed for gluing: they assume the existence of a set of
          powerful components and are intended primarily for connecting components together.
          System programming languages are strongly typed to help manage complexity, while scripting languages are
          typeless to simplify connections between components and provide rapid application development.

          On a technical level, Ousterhout contrasted scripting vs. systems along the axes of type-safety and
          instructions-per-statement. On a design level, he characterized the new roles for each
          language class: systems programming is for creating components, and scripting is for gluing them together.

          languages in the category of C, C++, Rust, and D are distinguished in terms of their level of abstraction from
          the machine. These languages expose details of the underlying hardware like memory allocation/layout and
          fine-grained resource management.

          when you have an efficiency problem, how much freedom do you have to solve it? The wonderful part of low-level
          programming languages is that when you identify an inefficiency, it is within your power to eliminate the
          bottleneck by careful control over machine details.

          In the same way static types provide more confidence like ‚Äúthese two things I‚Äôm trying to add are definitely
          integers,‚Äù low-level languages provide more confidence that ‚Äúthis code will execute on the machine as I
          specified.‚Äù

          Linux has around 330 system calls, some of the system calls are very esoteric while some are very widespread.

          Some of the common system calls that you might have heard for which are used for file access are creat - to
          create a file, read, write, open, close.
          I included creat, because when Ken Thompson was asked is there anything he regrets about Unix, he said he
          wished syscall creat wasn't named as such. Also to note that creat is obsolete now because of open. üòÅ
          For process control, some of the common system calls are wait/waitpid - when you want to wait for a process to
          finish, kill - to kill a process, fork - to spawn a process.
          For network access some of the common system calls are socket - to create a socket, getsockopt, listen - to
          listen to the socket.

          It's a simple 10 step process. When you want to read a file from user space, you setup one register with
          file descriptor, one with the buffer where you want things to be read, and nbytes which will store how many
          bytes have been written. Once these registers have been setup the control shifts to the library procedure.
          The library procedure initiates syscalls with a software interrupt assembly language instruction.

          Each syscall has an integer associated with it. For example read is 0, open is 2.
          The argument to the interrupt is a number, which corresponds to the index of an array in the OS kernel
          with pointers to the functions that provide the requested service.

          The kernel lookups the register with the file descriptor, puts the result back in the buffer register and the

          One thing to also note is that system calls are expensive! There are two context switches involved, one when
          the control switches to the kernel and the second when the control switches back to the user space.

          2. the unfamiliarity of providing arguments as pointers

          strace is a linux utility which is incredibly useful for debugging closed source programs, or even finding out
          performance bottlenecks! We know that syscalls are expensive, so when you find out that your program is doing
          more open operations than you think it was, you can optimise that. Or when you have a closed source program
          that was supposed to open the file x, but it opened the file y instead, strace allows you to do that! It's a
          super power! üòÖ

          So if we want to write our own strace, how do we go about it? First, we need to know how to observe another
          process. If we think of it like a debugger, we'd want to attach our strace to a process.

          Once we know how to "observe" or attach to a process, we have to figure out all the system calls that this
          process we are attached to is making!

          Once we figure out when the syscalls are being made, we'd have to figure out how to fetch the register values
          to figure out what syscall is being made.

          The ptrace mechanism makes it possible for strace to interrupt the traced process every time a system call is
          invoked, capture the call, decode it, and then resume the execution of the traced process.

          The challenge is that every time a system call is invoked (eg. open, read, write, close), a context switch
          from user level to kernel level is required. This process tends to be usually complex and relatively slow.

          ptrace allows to the tracer to observe and even control the execution of the tracee. ptrace is pretty shady
          but also very powerful! It's also a security risk, so if we want to trace a process, one we need to be in the
          parent namespace of the process and second the tracee needs to give explicit permission to allowing itself to
          be traced.

          Everytime a syscall occurs in the traced process, a sigtrap is sent to ptrace and if you have a wait on the

          ptr::null_mut(),

        <aside class="notes">
          Ptrace comes to rescue again! It has a flag called PTRACE_SYSCALL which will arrange for the tracee to be
          stopped at the next entry to or exit from a system call, or after execution of a single instruction,
          respectively. From the tracer's perspective, the tracee will appear to have been stopped by receipt of a SIG‚Äê
          TRAP. So, for PTRACE_SYSCALL, for example, the idea is to inspect the arguments to the system call at the
          first stop, then do another PTRACE_SYSCALL and inspect the return value of the system call at the second stop.

          So this call will fetch all the registers for us! We need to know which register stores the number of the
          syscall. I found this out from googling, that this is stored in the orig_rax register!

        <aside class="notes">
          In conclusion, Rust is so much more empowering than C, or C++ for systems programming because it follows the
          adage if it compiles, it works. In systems programming, sometimes you must perform operations that
          cannot be statically verified as safe. Rust gives you the tools to wrap these operations in safe
          abstractions, meaning that what was once relegated to code comments or convention can be statically enforced
          by the Rust compiler. If you were to do the same in C/C++, there would be so many times you would
          have to take care of memory allocation, and freeing this memory and other nitty-gritties that come with
          working with C/C++ which means it not accessible and is intimidating for a lot of people. Empowering people to
          write programs that they otherwise would have not written is superpower that Rust has!
          Lastly, I would like to give a reminder that a lot of systems things aren't really that hard if explained in
          a way that makes sense.
          I think computer networking is a really good example of this -- a lot of people get really intimidated by
          networking, but a lot of the core concepts like IP addresses and ports and packets are not really that hard,
          and once you understand them you can learn a lot.
