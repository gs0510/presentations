        <aside class="notes">
          Before I begin talking about syscalls, I want to talk about what even is a systems programming language?
          It's a term you hear a lot when talking about Rust! How Rust is a new systems programming language? But what
          makes a programming language suitable for systems programming?

          What makes C, C++, Rust good candidates for systems programming and Python, Perl not so good candidates?
          I want us to take a tour through history, and talk about the evolution of systems programming languages!

          I will focus on these themes:
          1. What does it mean to be a systems programming language?
          2. What makes Rust a good candidate for systems programming language?
          3. Learn about containers and writing your own container in Rust!

          In Systems Programming Languages (Bergeron1 et al. 1972), the authors say: "A system is an integrated set of
          subprograms exceeding some threshold of size or complexity."

          Typical examples are systems for multiprogramming, translating, simulating, managing information, and time
          sharing.

          The paper then goes on to define what a "systems program" looks like!
          The system program is likely to be used to support other software and applications programs, but may also be a
          complete applications package itself.
          for example, most application programs read from and write to files on disk. The operating system, written in
          a systems programming language like C provides this functionality. It makes sure programs have the permissions
          to access the files, handles multiple programs accessing the same file, loads blocks of files into memory and
          so on.

          It is likely to be continuously evolving in the number and types of
          features it supports.
          This definition is fairly agreeable‚Äîcomputer systems are large-scale, long-used, and time-varying. However,
          while this definition is largely descriptive, a key idea in the paper is prescriptive: advocating for the
          separation of low-level languages from systems languages (at the time, contrasting assembly with FORTRAN).

          What is systems programming? You may visualize a computer as some sort of beast that obeys all commands. It
          has been said that computers are basically people made out of metal or, conversely, people are computers made
          out of flesh and blood. However, once we get close to computers, we see that they are basically mSoftware Engineer - achines that
          follow very specific and primitive instructions. In the early days of computers, people communicated with them
          by on and off switches denoting primitive instructions. Soon people wanted to give more complex instructions.
          For example, they wanted to be able to say X = 30 * Y; given that Y = 10, what is X? Present day computers
          cannot understand such language without the aid of systems programs. Systems programs (e.g. compilers,
          loaders, macro processors, operating systems) were developed to make computers better adapted to the needs of
          their users. Further, people wanted more assistance in the mechanics of preparing their programs.

          ‚ÄúScripting: Higher Level Programming for the 21st Century‚Äù (Ousterhout 1998)
          Scripting languages are designed for different tasks than system programming languages, and this leads to
          fundamental differences in the languages. System programming languages were designed for building data
          structures and algorithms from scratch, starting from the most primitive computer elements such as words of
          memory. In contrast, scripting languages are designed for gluing: they assume the existence of a set of
          powerful components and are intended primarily for connecting components together.
          System programming languages are strongly typed to help manage complexity, while scripting languages are
          typeless to simplify connections between components and provide rapid application development.

          On a technical level, Ousterhout contrasted scripting vs. systems along the axes of type-safety and
          instructions-per-statement. On a design level, he characterized the new roles for each
          language class: systems programming is for creating components, and scripting is for gluing them together.

          languages in the category of C, C++, Rust, and D are distinguished in terms of their level of abstraction from
          the machine. These languages expose details of the underlying hardware like memory allocation/layout and
          fine-grained resource management.

          when you have an efficiency problem, how much freedom do you have to solve it? The wonderful part of low-level
          programming languages is that when you identify an inefficiency, it is within your power to eliminate the
          bottleneck by careful control over machine details.

          In the same way static types provide more confidence like ‚Äúthese two things I‚Äôm trying to add are definitely
          integers,‚Äù low-level languages provide more confidence that ‚Äúthis code will execute on the machine as I
          specified.‚Äù

		  Is a container a process? What‚Äôs Docker? Are containers Docker? Help! The word ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù doesn‚Äôt
		  mean anything super precise. Basically there are a few new Linux kernel features (‚Äúnamespaces‚Äù and
		  ‚Äúcgroups‚Äù) that let you isolate processes from each other. When you use those features, you call it ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù.
		  Basically these features let you pretend you have something like a virtual machine, except it‚Äôs not a virtual
      machine at all, it‚Äôs just processes running in the same Linux kernel.
      
      You might have said one or more of:

    A way to share resources
    Process Isolation
    Kind of like lightweight virtualisation
    Packaging a root filesystem and metadata together
    Kind of like a chroot jail
    Something something shipping container something
    Whatever docker does

That is quite a lot of things for one word to mean! The word ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù has started to be used for a lot of (sometimes overlapping) concepts. It is used for the analogy of containerisation, and for the technologies used to implement it. If we consider these separately, we get a clearer picture. So, let‚Äôs talk about the why of containers, and then the how. (Then we‚Äôll come back to why, again).

      In the beginning, there was a program. Let's call the program run.sh, and what we‚Äôd do is we‚Äôd copy it to a remote server, and we would run it. However, running arbitrary code on remote computers is insecure and hard to manage and scale. So we invented virtual private servers and user permissions. And things were good.

But little run.sh had dependencies. It needed certain libraries to exist on the host. And it never worked quite the same remotely and locally. (Stop me if you‚Äôve heard this tune). So we invented AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) and VMDKs (VMware images) and Vagrantfiles and so on, and things were good.

Well, they were kind-of good. The bundles were big and it was hard to ship them around effectively because they weren‚Äôt very standardised. And so, we invented caching.

            It would be nice if creating a container was as simple as just a create_container system call. It‚Äôs not. But honestly, it‚Äôs close.

To talk about containers at the low level, we have to talk about three things. These things are namespaces, cgroups and chroot. There are other things, but these three make up the majority of the magic.

            Linux namespaces were inspired by the wider namespace functionality used heavily throughout Plan 9 from Bell Labs.[1]
           Just as chroot allows processes to see any arbitrary directory as the root of the system (independent of the rest of the
           processes), Linux namespaces allow other aspects of the operating system to be independently modified as well. This
           includes the process tree, networking interfaces, mount points, inter-process communication resources and more.
      in a pid namespace you become PID 1 and then your children are other processes. All the other programs are gone
       in a networking namespace you can run programs on any port you want without it conflicting with what‚Äôs already running   
      in a mount namespace you can mount and unmount filesystems without it affecting the host filesystem. So you can have a totally different set of devices mounted.

            Linux namespaces were inspired by the wider namespace functionality used heavily throughout Plan 9 from Bell Labs.[1]
           Just as chroot allows processes to see any arbitrary directory as the root of the system (independent of the rest of the
           processes), Linux namespaces allow other aspects of the operating system to be independently modified as well. This
           includes the process tree, networking interfaces, mount points, inter-process communication resources and more.

          Containers aren‚Äôt magic. Anyone with a Linux machine can play around with them and tools like Docker and rkt are
          just wrappers around things built into every modern kernel. No, you probably shouldn‚Äôt go and implement your
          own container runtime. But having a better understanding of these lower level technologies will help you work
          with these higher level tools (especially when debugging).
          In conclusion, Rust is so much more empowering than C, or C++ for systems programming because it follows the
          adage if it compiles, it works. In systems programming, sometimes you must perform operations that
          cannot be statically verified as safe. Rust gives you the tools to wrap these operations in safe
          abstractions, meaning that what was once relegated to code comments or convention can be statically enforced
          by the Rust compiler. If you were to do the same in C/C++, there would be so many times you would
          have to take care of memory allocation, and freeing this memory and other nitty-gritties that come with
          working with C/C++ which means it not accessible and is intimidating for a lot of people. Empowering people to
          write programs that they otherwise would have not written is superpower that Rust has!
          Lastly, I would like to give a reminder that a lot of systems things aren't really that hard if explained in
          a way that makes sense.
          I think computer networking is a really good example of this -- a lot of people get really intimidated by
          networking, but a lot of the core concepts like IP addresses and ports and packets are not really that hard,
          and once you understand them you can learn a lot.
