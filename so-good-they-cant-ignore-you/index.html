        <aside class="notes">
          So I think the first thing I want to point out is that the talk is terribly titled. At the time of writing the
          proposal for this talk, I had not read the book "So good they can't ignore you!". Well I still haven't, but
          based from the summary of the book I can confidently say that what I'm going to be talking about is very
          different from what the book talks about. But my feelings of the book aside, what I want you to take away from
          this talk is actionable items to get your work noticed!

          Self promotion is not something that comes easily to most people.

          It could be because of various reasons. You're taught to be modest, it could be very cultural, your
          upbringing, whatever be the reason. And I want to make that easier for people, or at least have a structure in
          place where doing this is not painful.

          The talk is divided into three themes:
          1. About the myth of meritocracy.

          2. How to get your work noticed?
          3. Pitfalls you might get into?

          4. How to help others around you?

          So this talk is about dispelling some myths around meritocracy, building a framework so you know the work you
          do and those around you do as well and how to help others around you!

        <h2><em style="font-size: 150%">The myth of meritocracy</em>
        </h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          The intent to be meritocratic is not a myth, but we know what road is paved with good intentions. …
          It’s time to apply our heartfelt belief that as engineers we are rational, and rationally accept
          what the data is telling us: it isn’t a meritocracy. We are all biased.

        <h2><em style="font-size: 137%">What is a meritocracy?</em>
        </h2>
        <h3>
          The belief that everyone has an equal opportunity for success based on personal
          achivement and merit.
        </h3>
        <aside class="notes">
          tech certainly intends to be a meritocracy. We are supposed to reward merit and impact, not politics or
          who-you-know. I’m not saying nepotism doesn’t happen, but it is against the rules in a way it might not be in
          other industries.
          It’s particularly hard for powerful people like CEOs to see tech as anything but a meritocracy because the
          system rewarded them, and so that must have been on merit, right? You will find that female CEOs hold exactly
          the same beliefs, though we’d never be so crass as to call them sexist for it.

      <section>
        <h2><em style="font-size: 117%">The Problem with Meritocracy</em></h2>
        <h3>
          Individuals can and should be measured on the basis of their intellectual
          contributions, divorced from identity, gender, race, or other distinguishing
          characteristics.
        </h3>

        <aside class="notes">
          The first problem with this is the assumption of equal access and information that meritocracy relies on is
          clearly missing in the tech community. Even thought we have the internet and access to vast information, it
          can't be said that we have equal access to information.
          “We are humans, working with humans, to develop software for the benefit of humans.” A
          significant problem with our already flawed notion of meritocracy: within this system, the worth of the
          individual is measured not by their humanity, but solely by their intellectual output.
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2>Meritocracy is based on a <span class="underlined">utilitarian</span> interpretation of our work.</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          Utilitarianism as a philosophical system states that the most moral action is the one that maximizes utility:
          in essence, that the end justifies the means. But one of the well-noted problems of adopting utility as the
          primary measure of morality is that it ignores the concept of justice, as cruel actions are condoned so long
          as they contribute to the greater good. In its rejection of social justice, utilitarianism is essentially a
          dehumanizing philosophy. It objectifies people, reducing them to the level of tools or instruments for the
          “greater good”, which in most cases is code for whatever delivers maximum comfort.
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2><em style="font-size: 137%">The paradox of meritocracy</em></h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          Emilio J. Castilla, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, has explored how meritocratic ideals and
          HR practices like pay-for-performance play out in organizations, and he’s come to some unexpected conclusions.
          But Castilla’s analysis revealed some very non-meritocratic outcomes. Women, ethnic minorities, and
          non-U.S.-born employees received a smaller increase in compensation compared with white men, despite holding
          the same jobs, working in the same units, having the same supervisors, the same human capital, and
          importantly, receiving the same performance score. The paradox of meritocracy builds on other research showing
          that those who think they are the most objective can actually exhibit the most bias in their evaluations.
          To summarize, no one cares about your work as much as you do.

        <h2>How to make your work visible!</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          Two of our biggest challenges include developing our personal brand and proving our value.
          At some point in time in your career, you will have to prove your value, but it can be hard to
          talk about your achievements without underselling yourself, or feeling like you’re boasting.
          Hopefully we can help you overcome this hurdle by providing you with some proven tools
          to help you hype yourself! There’s this idea that, if you do great work at your job, people will (or should!)
          automatically recognize that work and reward you for it with promotions / increased pay. In practice, it’s
          often more complicated than that – some kinds of important work are more visible/memorable than others. It’s
          frustrating to have done something really important and later realize that you didn’t get rewarded for it just
          because the people making the decision didn’t understand or remember what you did.

          Your personal brand can be best described as what people say about you when you are not

          When it comes to your personal brand, its not a question of whether you have one.
          But whether you conscious choose to guide and cultivate or let it be defined for you.

          <li class="fragment">Your manager doesn't remember all the cool things you did!</li>
          <li class="fragment">Write a document listing everything you're proud of!</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Julia Evans has a great blog post about writing a brag document. So what is a brag document?
          In most places, every 6 months, or a year or a quarter you have to go through performance
          reviews, when you're scrambling to think of all the things you did in that year/6 months/quarter.
          It is not meant to be a resume, a self evaluation or a vision board. Each of those
          serve their own purpose, but are somewhat different.
          Instead, it is a living list of your achievements and your accomplishments. You use
          it to track the small and big impacts that you’ve made.
          You may have the best manager in the world, but in reality your manager doesn’t know
          about all the work that you’ve done, and especially what work you’re proudest of. Having a
          Hype Doc gives your manager a quick and easy list to use for reference. It also makes your
          life easier if you ever have to write a self evaluation.
          In the context of creating an Experience Map, it works as an excellent backend
          database where you can keep track of your achievements, and then once a year you can
          look through they Hype Doc and use it to update your Experience Map.

          List your major goals here! Sharing your goals with your manager & coworkers is really nice because it helps
          them see how they can support you in accomplishing those goals!
          Did you help with the desgin doc, did you help get several teams get onboard with the idea?, what was the
          impact your work have? Is it numerical, did it help bring in x% more revenue, or did it help pass a non
          numerical goal like this was required for GDPR.
          Believing that you're a junior engineer and cannot mentor someone is wrong!! You can totally mentor others,
          when someone new joins the team, help them with onboarding, mentor an intern, helping other teams trying to
          use your team's software, giving an internal workshop.
          Helping out with interviewing, ensuring that the interview process is fair.
          Participation outside of work could be contributing to a an open source project you like, a blog post, etc.

        <h2><em>Don't forget the invisible work!</em></h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          A lot of us work on fuzzy projects that can feel hard to quantify, like:
          improving code quality on the team / making code reviews a little more in depth
          making on call easier
          building a more fair interview process / performance review system
          refactoring / driving down technical debt
          A lot of people will leave this kind of work out because they don’t know how to explain why it’s important.
          But I think this kind of work is especially important to put into your brag document because it’s the most
          likely to fall under the radar! Explain the goal, list the things you did to achieve that goal and look at
          how visible the effects are! Maybe your co-workers can help you figure out how to make the impact more
          visible.

          In general, especially if you’re someone who really cares about your work, I think it’s really positive to
          share your goals & accomplishments (and the things that haven’t gone so well too!) with your friends and
          coworkers. It makes it feel less like you’re working alone and more like everyone is supporting each other in

        <h2>What's so great about having a brag doc?</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          One of the greatest things about having a brag doc in my opinion is you find out immediately
          when you're not progressing or learning enough. The first time I ever had a review was just after 4 months
          I started my job, and when I was scrambling to find what I did for the past 4 months, I realized I did not
          learn as much as I wanted, the work I was doing was not reflecting what my goals were and there were so many
          things I cared about, for which I did nothing at all. Having a brag doc is a great to immediately find out
          when things are going not so well and act on it!

        <aside class="notes">
          Just like you wouldn’t want someone else to determine your personal brand, you also
          shouldn’t want others to tell your story. Once you have defined your personal brand – live it
          with your actions and words. Share it by being your authentic self so that others around
          you start to see your brand through your lens.
          A critical part of sharing your brand is by staying connected and building authentic
          relationships and getting your brand out there. Networking is how your brand will work for
          you and create opportunities in the future. You are who you connect with. Getting out and
          meeting new people outside of your comfort zone is how you can create new and exciting
          opportunities and share your personal brand.

        <aside class="notes">
          I am a huge introvert and I kind of hate a big thing about building your personal brand
          is networking. This is so far out of my comfort zone that sometimes it makes me really upset.
          However over the years I have discovered these hacks that I hope can help you too!
          The advantange of having a blog or of being on a microblogging site is
          you can take your time, formulate your thoughts, and engage in real dialogue with others.

          Become a connector, one person at a time. Each week or every two weeks ask a different person
          at work for coffee or lunch. you can make yourself professionally indispensable if you develop connections
          that enable you to break through silos, and identify and surmount knowledge gaps.

          Speaking is great, because you already have spent a lot of time thinking about whatever you're going
          to talk about and once you're done with the talk, people can come up to you and you already have something
          to talk about!

          One of pitfalls that you might fall into as a junior engineer is glue work. Tanya Reily has an
		  incredible talk about glue work, it's when the non-technical aspects of your job like writing the
		  docs, establishing coding standards, setting up collaboration with other teams etc fall upon your
		  shoulder because it's something that you really care about and thus a part of your personal brand.
